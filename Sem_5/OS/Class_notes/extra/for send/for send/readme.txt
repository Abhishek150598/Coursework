For assignments 2-5 all are sub-parts are done using one shell script each. Just use sub-part to execute.
Following is an example for executing 2b

chmod +x ass2.sh
./ass2.sh b

Shell program.... I have forgotten what state that is in
Execute and report back

Multiple reader write, that is the last assignment
